according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.

This week we crimped and connected the peripherals on the build to the Raspberry Pi and motor controllers. We had some issues with the crimping tool but other than that things went pretty smooth, and everything powered up properly without any sparks!

Harnessing is pretty neat around the peripherals, but starts getting chaotic as it gets closer to the controllers. For now, we'll definitely be running the motors slowly while we 3D-print some parts for managing the wires.

In the next week, hopefully all the electronics will migrate towards their final home, a big black box, so they can be stored away neatly. This will also allow us to clean up the wires around the controllers a bit better, and test out the thermals in an enclosed box.
